Good Morning,

We are excited to announce a new contest for this week. 

Over the weekend some of our BadDogs were caught doing some Bad stuff...

In this contest, you must create "breaking news" articles with any bad dog. We ask you to pick any live photo of the news and paste your dog into any news broadcast. Write a funny or good title as to why the dog is in the news. 

Post your submission on Twitter using #BadDogsNews and tag @BadDogsCompany

At the end of the contest, the BadDogs team will select entries for the community to vote on the winners. (3 WL available)

##### Submissions for the contest will end on June 4, 2022 6:00 AM

Goodluck all contestants!
