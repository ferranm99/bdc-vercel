We would like to provide more details about our Bad Dogs Adoption Program as promised last week.

#### What is the Bad Dogs Adoption Program? 

 This program is designed to help non-holders secure a dog. These dogs are reserved for non-holders ONLY!  We believe all adopted Bad Dogs will be very special to their new owners. ðŸ¥° 

#### Wen Adopt?

Starting today, any Bad Dog with an expired OpenSea listing will go into the Adoption Program!  A team member will take these dogs out for some well-deserved love and attention, where the dogs will enjoy their time running around in our dog park. The BDC team will randomly decide which dog to put up for adoption. 

#### How to Adopt? 

Dogs will be put up for adoption at random times in our #bdc-adoption via giveaway bot. Each giveaway will have a different expiration, ranging from 10 mins to as long as 24 hrs.

We've received much feedback from non-holders in this community regarding a lack of non-holder opportunities to secure a dog. We hope this program will help bridge some of that gap. Good luck with finding your forever dog!

Enjoy the rest of your day!
