#### UPDATE: SOLD OUT WITHIN 3 mins

As you know all Bad Dogs from the 20 WL winners has been delivered so, what are we doing now?

Many of you are asking us when it will be possible to get a Bad Dog and how?

#### When?
It will be pretty simple. Tomorrow at 3PM UTC we will release 20 Bronze tokens on Opensea (link will be share tomorrow).

#### How?
This token will be exchangeable against a Bad Dogs the week after or tradable on Opensea in a different collection than the Bad Dogs Company. That means that you can keep your token for days, weeks, months... or ask for an exchange.

We will set a channel on the discord to manage these trades.

Quick reminder, all dogs are hand-drawn, so we can't tell when it will be your turn but as you noticed for the WL, the last delivery was quick.

#### Price
Previous sale were at 0.03eth but as we told you it was the last sales at that price. The new price is now 0.1eth

If you cannot grab a token, it's not the end, There will be 888 Bad Dogs ðŸ˜‰

We know that, this is a small supply and all the team won't try to grab a token. Community first ðŸ’ª 

Hope you enjoy the news ðŸ¥³
