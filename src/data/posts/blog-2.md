#### BDC Auction to assist Ukraine

With our current release at #109, we are getting very close to our very first special edition dog!!  @13six | Founder  had decided that every triple number (e.g. #111, #222, etc) will be a special dog that will go to the auction. Since this will be our first auction, we want to make it extra memorable.

As you are aware, Russia has launched a devastating attack on Ukraine and its people. The conflict between the two countries continues to escalate and the impact on civilians is tremendous.  For the auction of #111, the team had agreed to dedicate this Bad dog to aid in the emergency relief efforts of the Ukrainian people. All proceeds from the auction will go towards a donation that will help protect those most in need, ensuring they have a safe refuge and necessities for their survival.

We will appreciate it very much if you can help spread the word and increase participation in this auction and our effort to help relieve the pain of this massive crisis.

Thank you so very much!
