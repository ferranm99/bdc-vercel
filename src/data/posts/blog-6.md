Hi everyone !

@13six had discovered some Bad Dogs in our collection! The BDC team had come up with the Bad Dog Bounty Program to hunt them down! 

#### What is the Bad Dog Bounty Program?

The main purpose of this program is to hunt down Bad Dogs in our collection that doesn't fully align with 13Six's artistic vision. As our collection grows, there will inevitably be artistic elements that doesn't fully align. The program is specifically created to identify and address these shortcomings.

#### How do we know which dog is on the Wanted list?

From time to time, the core team will display a Wanted Poster that identifies the dog that we would like to revise. The Bounty Hunter can either purchase the dog from OpenSea or if you are the owner of that dog, you can simply transfer that dog back to 13Six's wallet for revision and notify a core team member.

#### What is the reward?!?

This is the best part! For your trouble of being the Bounty Hunter, 13Six will replace the wanted dog with a Custom Dog specifically drawn for you!

Today we will kick off our Bounty Program with BDC#062!!  Good luck famüçÄ !
