Hi BDC fam!

The custom queue took a little longer than expected but @13six is finally able to release Bad Dog #222.

![BDC#156](/images/nft/bdc-222.jpg)

As with BDC#111, this Bad Dog will be auctioned for 48 hours.
The winner of the auction will also receive the hat below which was inspired by the Bad Dog that @Pops | Bad Dogs  own.

As you are aware the auction for BDC#111, was donated to assist Ukraine. It is important for us to be able to help our fellow BDC members whenever possible. So for BDC#222 we have decided to donate all the proceeds from the auction to @Pops | Bad Dogs 

I won't go into the details of why because many of you are already aware that he is going through a difficult time with medical treatments and family responsibilities. This is our way to help support him and show him our love.

Good luck on this great auction!! âœŠ
