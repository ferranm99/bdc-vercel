GM BadDogs,

We have decided to give WL priority to our active community members going forward. 

If you would like to be eligible to play in any of our WL games hosted in discord you must have a @Waiting List  role or be a BDC Holder.  Twitter giveaways will remain open for everyone

@WaitingList roles are giving upon request for non BDC holders that have reached level 5 in our discord. If you feel you have already reached this level please head over to ðŸ¥‡â”‚level-rank  and use the command !Rank. Once youâ€™ve reached level 5 or above please tag a team member to request your new role that acts as your access pass to our WL games! 

Thanks,
BadDogs Team
